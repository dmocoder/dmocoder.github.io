Rust piqued my interest back in 2018 when I learnt that it didn't support nulls. I realise now of course that lots of languages don't support nulls such as Haskell and Swift, but at the time I was using libraries that added discriminated unions and option types to C#. I was trying my best to avoid checking for nulls throughout my code so the thought of having this baked into the language sounded very appealing.

Then I learned that Rust was memory safe but had no garbage collector! Again something achieved in other languages but needless to say I was intrigued how a language could do all these things and still be fast.

### The Rust Programming Language

[The book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book) is an excellent guide to Rust. I worked through it from cover to cover over Christmas 2019 and have forgotten almost all of it. That's no slight on the book - its fantastic - Its just that I haven't written any Rust code since January. 

It's not that hard to start learning a new programming language but if you aren't using it regularly then it just won't stick. This blog is largely an exercise in learning and coding Rust to do just that - make it stick.

### Why Bother?

Rust has a lot of potential, largely due to its inherent safety. It is frequently touted as a replacement primarily for C++ as well as C and is now being used by the likes of Microsoft and Amazon for systems programming. As someone who has never had to do much C++ coding outside of some weird windows libraries I'm more interested in its modern syntax and its speed.
